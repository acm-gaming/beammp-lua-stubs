BeamMP & BeamNG Lua Stubs
=========================

This repository contains lightweight EmmyLua stub files for BeamMP server scripting (v3.x) and related BeamNG Lua APIs, so editors can provide autocompletion and inline docs without shipping the whole game/server.

⚠️ BeamNG functions are pulled from game lua files, and augmented with *LLMs* so may be incorrect ⚠️

Mark as a Source Root in IntelliJ IDEA
--------------------------------------
- Right-click `beamng-lua-stubs` -> `Mark Directory As` -> `Sources Root`.
- IntelliJ will index the stubs so Lua completion and navigation work across your project.
